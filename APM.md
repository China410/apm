## Technology


Most of these package managers are built in the same language / technology that they manage. In that sense we would hope to build this in AS3. However running AS3 on the command line may be tricky. 


- Use ADL to run an empty sprite AIR application from the command line and execute AS3 from there, `apm` could be a alias for `adl apm-app.xml` (seems unprofessional)
