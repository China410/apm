# AIR Package Manager (`apm`)

The AIR Package Manager allows management of AIR libraries and extensions and assists in creation of the application descriptor. 


It is comprised of a repository server and a command line client.


The goals of `apm` are to:

- be command line tool for macOS and Windows;
- read from a repository of packages (ANEs and SWCs);
- install (download) packages and dependencies;
- update packages and dependencies;
- assist in the creation of the application descriptor (particularly on iOS / Android to merge android manifest additions and iOS info additions / entitlements );


This project also aims to provide a repository server to be the store for packages.


See the [wiki](https://github.com/airsdk/apm/wiki) for details.
