> With the ever growing complexity of mobile development most other modern development platforms have a series of package management and merge tools to simplify the development process, particularly around adding third party components. These tools simplify the process of adding a component / library / plugin into an application, managing dependencies and merging manifests or plists.

> If AIR is to progress as a modern development tool I believe it is well past time that we have some similar tools at our disposal and as a community agree upon a series of standards around component descriptions. 
>
> I know there are proprietary tools that manage certain aspects of this process such as ane-lab and [Adobe Air Assistant](https://github.com/SaffronCode/Adobe-Air-Assistant) however these tools are highly customised to the integrated ANEs and would probably be better suited as UI components built upon a common standard.

> **This repository is designed to form the starting point of an open source "AIR package manager" - `apm`.**

> This tool would be similar to:
> - `npm` (node package manager);
> - `gradle` (Gradle);
> - `mvn` (Maven);
> - `pip` (package installer for python);
> - `haxelib` (Haxelib)
